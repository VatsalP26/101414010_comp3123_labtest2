Moving on, I have used React features like state, hooks, and lifecycle methods.
- State management using useState 
- Lifecycle methods like useEffect for data fetching 
- Hooks (like useEffect for fetching data when the component loads) 

For UI/UX-
I have make use of icons, themes and fonts

Then I have used Search by City feature to update based on user input.
